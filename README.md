Developed a time-series prediction model using Convolutional Neural Networks with the goal to predict average reimbursement rate of provider. This classifier was 12% more accurate and 27% faster in predicting reimbursement than existing method

RQ1. How accurately and precisely can we predict the average Medicare reimbursement rate for a particular provider in an upcoming year, given the ailments a patient currently suffers from? What other factors play a role in making such predictions? 

RQ2. Do the reimbursement rates for a provider impact their business in future years? In particular, will doctors with low Medicare reimbursement rates likely lose clients while doctors with high Medicare reimbursement rates gain clients?
